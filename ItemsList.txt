Item behavior:
	Items are generated using spawners. They get spawned depending on how much one as swim in a certain direction (randomized). They stay for a limited amount of time and distance. If the player is going in circles items will eventually spawn in every directions however they will depop after a certain time; if the player swims straight in one direction items will spawn in less directions and will only float as long as the player is near them (out of sight though).
